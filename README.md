# Founding Engineer – Systems, Kernels, and Embedded AI

**Location:** San Francisco (Onsite)  
**Type:** Full-time  
**Start Date:** ASAP

---

## What You'll Do

- Design and implement core systems that sit close to the kernel and hardware
- Build real-time hardware graph awareness across multiple boards, devices, and interfaces
- Integrate and abstract device I/O using low-level channels
- Terminal/session virtualization and multi-device orchestration
- Observability and tracing across Linux, networking, and embedded components
- Collaborate on AI- and agent-driven workflows
- Work directly with the founders to shape product direction, architecture, and engineering culture

---

## What You Bring

**Strong experience with:**

- Linux internals, kernel subsystems, device drivers
- Networking stacks, TCP internals, NIC behavior, and low-level data paths
- Compilers, program analysis, advanced debugging/instrumentation
- Microcontrollers and low-level protocols (UART, I2C, SPI, JTAG, etc.)
- Systems programming in C/C++ and Python

**Familiarity with:**

- Data center or distributed networking
- AI, agents, or MCP-style context systems
- Scripting and upper-stack work in JavaScript/TypeScript

## What We're Looking For

We're looking for a founding engineer who lives at the intersection of kernels, networks, compilers, and hardware — and who can quickly move up the stack into agents, APIs, and product.

**You should have:**

- Deep curiosity about hardware, kernels, and networks
- Comfort working in a high-intensity, high-ownership startup environment
- Ability to move quickly from prototype to production while maintaining reliability
- Desire to work end-to-end: from low-level mechanisms to user-facing experiences
- Excitement about building cracked tools with a cracked team

**Requirements:**

- Master's or PhD in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Networks, or equivalent experience
- Willingness to work startup hours, in-person (weekends included) at our San Francisco office
- Work authorization in the United States

---

## Why Join

We're building the intelligence layer for hardware — real-time systems that control physical machines with zero tolerance for latency or failure.

**What we offer:**

- Founding engineer-level equity and highly competitive salary
- Ownership over core architecture that defines the company's trajectory
- Problems that touch kernels, hardware, agents, and UX in one product
- Close collaboration with customers building cutting-edge embedded and networked systems
